## Token
The HANDS Token is used to power the Hands Network and works as a means to reward or get rewarded for participation in the marketplace. Each activity on the platform has an associated cost specified in HANDS (“or ꭍ”). In particular, if HANDS goes up in value, the insurance provided by the over and cross-collateralization pools will cover potential credit/default losses.

HANDS is transferred from one participant to another as activities are carried out on the Hands Network. Hands Network will be rewarded a fee subsequent to executing these activities.

Ownership of HANDS Token carries no rights other than the right to exchange and claim over the platform. HANDS does not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation relating to the Hands Network.

Our HANDS Tokens serve several key functions in our ecosystem:
- Credit enhancement reserve
- Transaction execution reward
- Rewards for good behavior
- Punishment for bad behavior
- Reward for providing information
- Platform access
- API license
